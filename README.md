# Pressure__Depth
This repository contains Python code for plotting the relationships between pressure-depth and temperature-depth, based on subsurface data.
The input data should be in CSV format, with the following columns:

depth: The depth of the subsurface measurement (in meters)
pressure: The pressure at that depth (in kilopascals)
temperature: The temperature at that depth (in degrees Celsius)
